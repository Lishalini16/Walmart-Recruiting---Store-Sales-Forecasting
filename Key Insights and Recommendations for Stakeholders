Key Insights and Recommendations for Stakeholders:

- Promotional Markdown Effectiveness:
MarkDown features, particularly MarkDown1 and MarkDown4, are among the most important factors influencing weekly sales (as per feature importance analysis).
Recommendation: Increase focus on markdown events, especially before key holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, to maximize sales.

- Seasonality of Sales:
Sales show a clear upward trend during holiday periods, with significant spikes around Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Recommendation: Enhance inventory planning and staffing during major holidays to meet increased demand effectively.

- Store-Specific Performance:
Certain stores consistently outperform others in average weekly sales, and store size (Size) is a significant predictor of sales.
Recommendation: Allocate resources proportionally to high-performing stores, such as stock and promotional budgets, and explore why underperforming stores lag.
These insights can help optimize operational planning and promotional strategies to improve overall store performance.
